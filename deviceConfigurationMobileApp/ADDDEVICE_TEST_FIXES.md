## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Added Missing Imports

**Problem**: `ReferenceError: Provider is not defined`, `ReferenceError: store is not defined`

**Fix**: Added React Redux imports
```javascript
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
import {store} from '../../src/store/configureStore';
```

### 2. ✅ Imported Required Functions

**Problem**: `ReferenceError: writeDataTolocalStorage is not defined`, `ReferenceError: onBackPressSaveDevice is not defined`

**Fix**: Added missing function imports from action file
```javascript
import {
  roomDropDown,
  updateSelectedSchool,
  roomListUpdate,
  writeDataTolocalStorage,      // ✅ Added
  onBackPressSaveDevice,          // ✅ Added
  isDuplicateMacAddress,          // ✅ Added
} from '../../src/screens/addDevice/action';
```

### 3. ✅ Added Test Cleanup

**Problem**: "Jest environment torn down" errors, async timer issues

**Fix**: Added proper cleanup and fake timers
```javascript
// Use fake timers to avoid async timer issues
jest.useFakeTimers();

// Global cleanup after each test
afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
  jest.clearAllTimers();
});
```

### 4. ✅ Added Testing Library Utilities

**Fix**: Imported `cleanup` and `act` from testing library
```javascript
import {fireEvent, render, screen, cleanup, act} from '@testing-library/react-native';
```

## Remaining Issues (10 tests still failing)

### Issue Categories

#### 1. Missing TestIDs (5 tests)
Tests are looking for testIDs that don't exist in the component:
- `deviceTypeProp`
- `schoolDropDownTouchable`
- `macProp`
- `serialProp`

**Possible Solutions**:
- Update component to add missing testIDs
- Update tests to use correct testIDs
- Check if component is rendering properly

#### 2. Function Calls Not Being Triggered (4 tests)
Mock functions/spies aren't being called as expected:
- Toast.show spy not called
- readValue spy not called  
- Navigation functions not triggered

**Possible Solutions**:
- Add proper event triggers in tests
- Ensure mocks are set up before component renders
- Verify component logic actually calls these functions

#### 3. Type/Undefined Errors (1 test)
```
TypeError: setDeviceTypeSelected is not a function
```

**Possible Solutions**:
- Check if this is a React state setter that needs to be mocked
- Verify the component is using proper hooks

## Tests Now Passing ✅

1. ✅ "should render add device correctly" (snapshot test 1)
2. ✅ "should render add device correctly" (snapshot test 2)
3. ✅ "should write a file"
4. ✅ "should throw an error while write a file"
5. ✅ "if macAddress is duplicate, it should return true"
6. ✅ "it should show toast if school is not selected" (one variant)

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Missing TestIDs
Review the AddDevice component and either:
1. Add the missing testIDs to the component elements
2. Update the tests to use the correct existing testIDs

### Priority 2: Fix Mock Setup
Ensure mocks are properly configured:
```javascript
// Example: Mock Toast before component renders
jest.spyOn(Toast, 'show');
```

### Priority 3: Review Component Logic
Some tests expect functions to be called that may not be triggered due to:
- Conditional rendering
- Missing user interactions
- Incorrect test setup

## Commands

**Run this test file**:
```bash
yarn test __tests__/screens/AddDevice-test.js --no-coverage
```

**Update snapshots if needed**:
```bash
yarn test __tests__/screens/AddDevice-test.js -u
```

**Run with verbose output**:
```bash
yarn test __tests__/screens/AddDevice-test.js --verbose
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Major improvements made**:
- Fixed all import errors
- Added proper cleanup
- Improved from 2/16 passing to 6/16 passing
- All snapshots now pass

⚠️ **Remaining work**:
- 10 tests still failing due to testID mismatches and mock setup issues
- These require component-level changes or test logic updates
- Not configuration issues - the test infrastructure is working correctly
