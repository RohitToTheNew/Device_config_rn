## Main Issues

### 1. ‚ùå BackHandler.removeEventListener Not Mocked

**Error**:
```
TypeError: _reactNative.BackHandler.removeEventListener is not a function
```

**Location**: `src/screens/bluetoothDevicesList/index.js:83:19`

**Problem**: The React Native BackHandler mock doesn't include `removeEventListener` method.

**Solution**: Add BackHandler mock with both `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`

```javascript
// Add to a mock setup file or __tests__/__mocks__/
jest.mock('react-native/Libraries/Utilities/BackHandler', () => ({
  addEventListener: jest.fn(() => ({ remove: jest.fn() })),
  removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
}));
```

---

### 2. ‚ùå BLE Error Constant Undefined

**Error**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'CharacteristicReadFailed')
```

**Function**: `identifyDeviceFromList`

**Problem**: BLE error enums/constants are not defined in the BLE mock.

**Solution**: Update `react-native-ble-plx-mock.js` to include error constants:

```javascript
jest.mock('react-native-ble-plx', () => ({
  BleManager: jest.fn(),
  BleError: {
    CharacteristicReadFailed: 'CharacteristicReadFailed',
    // Add other error codes as needed
  },
  // ... other mocks
}));
```

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Navigation Spy Not Called (4 tests)

**Tests Failing**:
- `performAuthProcess function ‚Ä∫ should take device id and perform auth process`
- `navigateToDevice function ‚Ä∫ should navigate to BLE device setings screen` 
- `navigateToDevice function ‚Ä∫ should navigate to device setings screen, when CZA1300 device is pressed`
- `navigateToDevice function ‚Ä∫ should read device type from BLE, then navigate to device settings screen`

**Problem**: 
```
expect(navigationSpy).toBeCalledWith('SetPasscode', ...)
expect(navigationSpy).toBeCalledWith('HomeScreen')

Expected number of calls: >= 1
Received number of calls:    0
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Navigation is mocked but not properly set up
2. Async operations not completing before assertions
3. Navigation function not being triggered due to missing dependencies
4. Test logic needs `await` or proper async handling

**Solutions**:
1. Check if navigation is properly mocked
2. Add proper async/await handling
3. Use `waitFor` from testing library for async assertions
4. Verify that the action functions actually call navigation

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Device Type Assertion Mismatch (1 test)

**Test**: `check device type ‚Ä∫ should check if the device found is CZA1300 device`

**Problem**:
```
Expected: "CZA1300"
Received: "MS-700"
```

**Cause**: Test expects device type to be "CZA1300" but the test data or setup is creating an "MS-700" device instead.

**Solution**: Fix test data setup to ensure correct device type is assigned during device discovery/setup.

## Tests Currently Passing ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ "should render devices list correctly" (snapshot)
2. ‚úÖ "on landing to bluetooth devices list ‚Ä∫ should render devices list correctly"
3. ‚úÖ "on landing to bluetooth devices list ‚Ä∫ should render devices list correctly" 
4. ‚úÖ "Bluetooth devices list found during discovery ‚Ä∫ should render devices list screen" (partially)
5. ‚úÖ And 6 more tests...

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Add BackHandler Mock

Create or update `__tests__/__mocks__/react-native-mock.js`:

```javascript
// Mock BackHandler
global.BackHandler = {
  addEventListener: jest.fn(() => ({
    remove: jest.fn(),
  })),
  removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
};
```

### Priority 2: Update BLE Mock

Update `__tests__/__mocks__/react-native-ble-plx-mock.js`:

```javascript
jest.mock('react-native-ble-plx', () => {
  const mockBleManager = {
    state: jest.fn(),
    onStateChange: jest.fn(),
    enable: jest.fn(),
    startDeviceScan: jest.fn(),
    stopDeviceScan: jest.fn(),
    connectToDevice: jest.fn(),
    // ... other methods
  };

  return {
    BleManager: jest.fn(() => mockBleManager),
    BleError: {
      CharacteristicReadFailed: 'CharacteristicReadFailed',
      DeviceDisconnected: 'DeviceDisconnected',
      OperationCancelled: 'OperationCancelled',
      // Add more as needed
    },
    State: {
      PoweredOn: 'PoweredOn',
      PoweredOff: 'PoweredOff',
    },
  };
});
```

### Priority 3: Fix Navigation Tests

The navigation tests might need:
1. Better async handling
2. Proper navigation mock setup
3. Check if navigation is actually being called in the code

## Summary

‚úÖ **Good News**: 
- 10 out of 17 tests passing (58.8%)
- Snapshot test passing
- Test infrastructure working correctly

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Attention**:
- 7 tests failing due to missing mocks and async issues
- Main issues: BackHandler.removeEventListener, BLE error constants, navigation spies
- These are fixable with proper mock updates

üéØ **Next Steps**:
1. Add BackHandler.removeEventListener mock
2. Add BLE error constants to mock
3. Debug navigation spy issues
4. Fix device type test data
